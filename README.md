# Abstract

Abstract: A TLDR summary of the findings of the project. Answer to the question: What is the best neighborhood? And How did you determine that answer (brief summary of metrics)

Overall, we determnined that the "best" worst neighborhood can be determined by:

(FINISH SUNDAY AFTERNOON)

We chose to answer the question of which Pittsburgh neighborhood is the most dangerous place to live in based on three datasets from the WPRDC. The first factor we chose was COVID-19 and its public health implications, taken from the "COVID-19 Counts by Municipality and Neighborhood" dataset, by calculating the number of Covid-19 cases per 100 individuals tested by neighborhood. The next factor we looked into was gun-violence, from the "Firearm Seizures Data" source, by finding the total numer of gun seizures by neighborhood. Finally, we used the "Allegheny County Median Age at Death" data to determine which neighborhoods had the lowest average lifespan, by finding the lowest median age of death per neighborhood. Overall, we concluded that the most dangerous neighborhood in Pittsburgh would be the one that has the greatest overlap of the most covid cases, the most firearms being seized, and the lowest median age at death. We ultimately arrived at our conclusion by sorting each of the datasets in decreasing order from top to bottom, ranking the top 35 neighborhoods in each set by assigning "ranks" from 1 (top) to 35 (bottom), finding which neighborhoods had overlap in each of the 3 categories, and ultimately arriving at our "best" neighborhood by identifying which of the overlapped neighborhoods had the lowest score: Manchester.
