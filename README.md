# Abstract

We believe that Manchester is the best "worst" Pittsburgh neighborhood to live in according to three datasets from the WPRDC. The first factor is COVID-19 and its public health implications, taken from the "COVID-19 Counts by Municipality and Neighborhood" dataset and measures the number of Covid-19 cases per 100 individuals tested by each neighborhood. The next factor is gun violence from the "Firearm Seizures Data" source which identifies the cumulative number of gun seizures by neighborhood. Finally, the "Allegheny County Median Age at Death" data shows which neighborhoods have the lowest average lifespan by listing the lowest median age of death per neighborhood. 

We conclude that the most dangerous neighborhood in Pittsburgh is the one with the greatest overlap of most Covid-19 cases, most firearms seized, and lowest median age at death. These individual metrics are combined by first sorting each of the datasets in decreasing order from top to bottom and ranking the top 35 neighborhoods in each set from 1 (top) to 35 (bottom). Consequently, the neighborhood with overlap in all 3 categories and has the lowest score is the "best" worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh: Manchester.
